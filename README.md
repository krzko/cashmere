ðŸ¤– Cashmere Bot
===============

## Description

Cashmere is a crypto trading bot that uses [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com) alerts to process orders. Using your TradingView strategies you can send alerts via email, Cashmere will then parse your email message and place an order on yout behalf.

Cashmere uses a distributed database back-end as its configuration store. All user data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 and at rest, using AES in counter mode. Upon first run of the application, you will be given a user GUID, which you need to keep safe. This will identify you on the system and allow you to restore your configuration at any time.
